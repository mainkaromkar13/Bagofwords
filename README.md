# Message Filtering System in Online Social Network

  Now-a-days, Online Social Networking sites are an important part of human society. In other way a person maintains a social networking site account which is then used for the following purposes like building relations, for business, exchange of data etc. The use of OSN’s is therefore tremendously increasing day by day and its demand for concentration over protection of private information of user’s, their likes and dislikes etc. There are different filtering criteria provided by various OSN’s but the role of the user to prevent his/her privacy is very less with the help of those criteria. This paper represents a model that helps to allow the user to take over the control of their profile’s and walls. The key parameters of the proposal illustrate that the message posted on user wall’s will be filtered for unwanted content in any form and type and will be posted with the users consent only. The feasibility of this model is presented considering OSN’s scenarios.
